### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### What Iâ€™m doing
Iâ€™m currently making a series of games in Godot called Forgettable Memories. I am currently learning C, Python, Go and Rust.

### Who Iâ€™m
Iâ€™m a Brazilian student of programming and I am about to start university. I started make games in Godot and I have some unfinished projects in my itch.io, but now I want to go deeper into the code and make games in C or something like that. 

How to reach me: My itch.io account is [smileydroid.itch.io](https://smileydroid.itch.io) and my twitter account is [@TheSmileyDroid](https://twitter.com/TheSmileyDroid)
